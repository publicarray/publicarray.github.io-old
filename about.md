# About Me
I am a student studying Information Technology and Multimedia. I have worked on Web Applications both front and backend. My goal is to be a Web Developer or Software Engineer. Maybe I can combine this with Information Security (InfoSec). The internet, web applications and open source projects have always been a passion of mine.

<br>
I believe websites should be fast for everyone, simple, secure and not evade the privacy of it's users. I intend to make the web a safer place one website at at time, following industry best practices. I am interested in using agile development and I strongly believe in the importance of version control systems such as git with Github or Bitbucket for collaborative coding.

<br>
Some of my open sourced projects:
- [Real-time-CRUD](https://github.com/publicarray/Real-time-CRUD)
- [Solar System](https://github.com/publicarray/solarsystem)
- [My Dotfiles](https://github.com/publicarray/dotfiles)

<br>
Open source projects I contributed to:
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
- [User.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js) by pyllyukko

Outside of my career I like to take photographs. You can see my best work [here](https://publicarray.com/gallery).
