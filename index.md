# Hello, I'm Sebastian.
I'm an Australian developer fresh out of University who is interested in information security and open-source software. I believe websites should be fast for everyone, simple, secure and not evade the privacy of it's users. I intend to make the web a safer place one website at at time, following the industry's (OWASP) best practices.
